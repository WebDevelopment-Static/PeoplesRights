## Client, White & Case 

### In Progress 

## Things that need to be included in the language:
The board of directors has keep control of the board with the help of MGXX  by violating shareholders civil rights and falsifying information.  
Courtney SXX MXX, now a board member until late 2017 was working with the majority of shareholders to uncover the fraud, before turning critical information to the Board to gain a seat on the board of directors. 
More than $25 Million dollars in Real Estate are missing from the property, including more than 30 units and over five thousand SQ FT of public space,  hallways and rooftop areas sold to private units. 
The LSXX after filing for bankruptcy under the same management awarded a 99 years lease for all commercial spaces of the LSXX to the managing agent in violation of New York Law. 
Ms DelXXX a former board member has collected 2 Million dollars in legal fees while residing full time in Florida and coming once a year to conduct the shareholders meeting. 
In an attempt to prevent Ms Laura V from uncovering the fraud and after Ms V  had open an investigation with the New York Attorney General, and created a public blog while making public the financial damage being done, the Board and Managing agent, falsely accused and try to evict Ms V  from the premises, and practice harassment which includes, physical and legal threats, insults, defamation, theft of emails via hacking, and physical damage to her private property (conedison and postal services now investigating) 





Laura V, on behalf of shareholders, and derivatively on behalf of Txx Lxxx S  (the “LSxx”), as and for her Complaint herein, alleges the following:
1.	We are bringing this action under New York Corporation Law (“NY Bus Corp L“), Power and Trusts Law (the “EPTL”) and the common law as the representative of the Lxx Sxxxx.

S’s ongoing self-dealing includes selling LSXX property for personal gain, selling LSXX property that are not memorialized,  conducting numerous activities and businesses inside the LSXX for many years in violation of the house rules before changing those rule, all to have served his own financial interests rather than those of the LSXX.  Mr. S also has used LSXX as a vehicle to facilitate services to his construction business expenses scheme. Finally Mr S has used the LSXX’s staff members for his personal business and activities and to harass shareholders who did not agree with his behaviour. For most of the time that S has been affiliated with LSXX, the Board and Managing Agent has facilitated his self dealing, knowingly or not, by granting Shait blanket authority to act on LSXX’s behalf and by failing to oversee his stewardship of the organization. 
	2.The LSXX Directors, S and the other individual defendants, are jointly and severally personally liable and financially accountable for the injury to the LSXX resulting from (1) self-dealing transactions and distributions of the corporation’s property that they undertook, improperly authorized or failed to authorized and that were not fair and reasonable to LSXX at the time they occurred, (2) their failure to discharge the duties of their respective positions in good faith and with that degree of diligence, care and skill which ordinarily prudent persons would exercise under similar circumstances in like position, (3) their neglect of, or failure to perform, or other violation of their duties in the management and disposition of corporate assets committed to their charge, and (4) their acquisition or transfer to others, loss or waste of corporate assets due to neglect of, or failure to perform, or other violation of their duties. 
	3.Defendants, as directors and officers of the LSXX, breached their duties of care and loyalty to the LSXX by, among other things, (1) allowing LSXX to incur property loss without fair and reasonable in violation of NY Bus Corp L § 717 (b)(a); (2) voting for, concurring or acquiescing in applications of LSXX’s assets to an officer’s personal use in violation of NY Bus Corp L §  717 (b)(a); (3) failing to discharge their duties to LSXX pursuant to NY Bus Corp L § 717 (a); (4) incurring liability to LSXX by voting for, concurring or acquiescing in distributing LSXX’s property, contrary to the NY Bus Corp L § 720 (a)(1)(A)
	4. In bringing this action, Laura Ventoso in behalf of shareholders seeks judgment, inter alia: (a) directing S and the other defendants directors and officers to account for all transfer of property including the corporation's units and all public spaces; (b) determining that S’s self-dealing transactions violated the provisions of NY Business Corporate Law; (c) determining that the directors breached their fiduciary duties to LSXX; (d) determining that the directors and officers are jointly and severally liable to LSXX for all distributions, loss or waste of LSXX’s assets made in violation of the NY Business Corporate Law and for all liability incurred by LSXX; (e) directing defendant Shait and the other defendants to make restitution to LSXX for any waste , loss or misdirection of the LSXX’s assets resulting from defendant's’ misconduct, with interest; (f) awarding judgment against defendants for all damages, including any losses incurred by reason of the LSXX’s loss of income on all amounts improperly transferred; (g) awarding judgment against defendants removing them as directors and officers of LSXX; (h) ejecting MGXX from the LSXX commercial leases ; (i) determining that defendants have breached their fiduciary duties to the LSXX in violation of Article 8 of the EPTL and are liable to LSXX for damages caused by their breaches of duty; (j) determining that Del must forfeit all salary received or credited to her for the entire period of her disloyalty to LSXX; (k) awarding to Laura Ventoso the costs and disbursements of bringing this action, including attorneys’ fees, investigators, forensic financial accounts and forensic engineering, and all charges incurred on behalf of the defendants and not reimbursed, court costs and expenses; and (l) granting such other and further relief a this Court deems just and proper.
